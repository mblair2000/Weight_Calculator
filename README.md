# Weight_Calculator
This is my first personal project. It is used to calculate possible weights on each end of a barbell in a gym.

This is my first personal project ever. The idea came to me when working out. So many people, myself included, will work out at home gyms where you need specific plates to equal specific total weights on each side of a barbell. This code will take in a weight as an argument and spit out the most logical combination of weights for each side of a barbell.

Note if you run my java file by itself through a command line or something, you may take out the package statement at the top or else it won't run.
